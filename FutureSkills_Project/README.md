# FutureSkills_Project: FORECAST DAILY ELECTRICITY PRICES FOR HEDGING - APPLICATION OF ARIMA
1: Data loading, time_series formation, stationarity check and ACF/PACF plotting was done using MATLAB [live editor](https://github.com/wikwikwok/Final_Projects/blob/main/FutureSkills_Project/Futureskills_Project.mlx). The documented format can be seen [here](https://github.com/wikwikwok/Final_Projects/blob/main/FutureSkills_Project/Futureskills_Project_Documentation.pdf)


2: ARIMA model was developed through the Econometrics toolbox provided by MATLAB through which an equivalent [live function](https://github.com/wikwikwok/Final_Projects/blob/main/FutureSkills_Project/modelTimeSeries.mlx) and a subsequent [report](https://github.com/wikwikwok/Final_Projects/blob/main/FutureSkills_Project/TimeSeriesReport_MATLAB_Generated.pdf) was generated.
